# World Weather Analysis (PlanMyTrip app)


## Overview
To take the PlanMyTrip app to the next level, the following requests were made to be done:

1. Add weather deasciption to the weather data
2. Use Input statements to get and filter the data for the preferences.
3. This will be used to identify potential destinations and nearby hotels. Google Directions API enabled.
4. Create itinerary for up to 4 cities.
5. Create travel route between the 4 cities, including a marker layer map.


### Prior work done.

. Collect and analyse weather data across cities worldwide.
. Use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on client's preferences
. Create DF of cities and their weather data (collect, analyse and visualize)

This entailed using the OpenWeatherMap API to collect JSON data based on the latitudes and longtitudes obtained from the citpy module.
Different plots (scatter, heatmaps with pop-up markers) were created by finding coordinates and information using Google's Maps and Places API and Search Nearby feature.
